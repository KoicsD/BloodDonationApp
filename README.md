# Welcome to my BloodDonationApp!

In this repository I would like to implement my own version of Blood Donation Database Manager from repository [*CharliesAngels*](https://github.com/KoicsD/CharliesAngels/). This is meant to be a kind of summarizing my studies in [*Python*](https:www.python.org/).

In the directory [*UML*](UML/) I have a lot of plan as UML diagrams. As you can see, I have a very object-oriented and very-very modulary point of view.  
To make some details clear in my code, I intend to create a directory named *Samples*, where short but useful tricks will be presented via mini-projects.  
I would also like to make a directory *TestCode*, where all my unit- and integrity tests would take place.

Task Descriptions are inherited from [*CharliesAngels*](https://github.com/KoicsD/CharliesAngels/):
* [General](TaskDescription/InitialOrder.md)
* [Week5](TaskDescription/OrdersWeek5.md)
* [Week6](TaskDescription/OrdersWeek6.md)
* [Week7](TaskDescription/OrdersWeek7.md)

Thank you for visiting my repository! :D
